  # Both values are printed in the release workflow's run summary ("Homebrew source
  # checksum"), so bumping a version is a copy/paste.
  #
  # Whatever you take the checksum from, check it is an archive first. A `curl | shasum` while
  # GitHub was returning 429 once put the hash of a 199-byte error page in here, and a formula
  # with the wrong checksum does not fail loudly — it downloads, mismatches, and looks like a
  # hung install.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      The file-tree icons need a Nerd Font. To install the bundled one for your user:
        clee --install-font

      A copy also lives at:
        #{opt_pkgshare}/fonts

      On macOS, to give CleeCode an icon in the Dock and let Finder open
      files with it (needs Ghostty, and builds the bundle locally so it
      arrives without Gatekeeper's quarantine):
        clee --install-app

      Previews are optional extras, not requirements — without them CleeCode
      simply shows less, rather than failing:
        brew install poppler     PDF pages (ghostscript also works)
        brew install pandoc typst  Markdown as a real document, pictures and all
        brew install chafa       pictures inside a terminal pane

      The numeric workspaces (clee -w octave, clee -w pylab) drive the
      interpreter you already have, and nothing is installed into it.
      Nothing here is bundled either:
        brew install octave      an Octave session to run cells in
        pip install matplotlib   plots from a Python session — it has to be
                                 the same python your terminal runs
